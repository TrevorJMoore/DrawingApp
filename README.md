# DrawingApp
A visual basic windows application to draw and create images.
## Description / Usage
The DrawingApp is a paint-esque application that allows you to paint on a canvas with various different shapes.

### Tools
The "tools" section of this application comes with some utility options to help flesh out your drawings. There are four buttons in this group:
1. Reset - Allows users to reset their canvas, removing any drawings they may have placed.
2. Eraser - Allows users to erase parts of their drawings.
3. Open - Allows users to open images and use them as a background in their drawings.
4. Save - Allows users to save their creations.

### Shapes
The "shapes" section of this application comes with numerous shapes to help users draw their perfect piece of art. The main shapes are:
1. Line - A basic line.
2. Circle - A circle with the option to increase both its width and height.
3. Square - A square/rectangle with the option to increase both its width and height.
4. Polygon - A polygon with the option to set the number of sides and the length of the sides.
5. Icon - A rubber ducky icon with the option to increase both its width and height.

### Colors
The "colors" section comes with primary colors preloaded in the paint bar. 

#### Selecting a color
Selecting a color in the paint bar changes the brush color to the selected one. 

The currently selected color fills in the "Selected Color" square to help identify which color is currently applied to the brush. 

The previously selected color fills in the "Previous Color" square which users can click on to change the brush color to the previously used color.

#### Editting Colors
Selecting the "Edit Colors" square opens a color picker menu where, after choosing a color, users can:
1. Click on a square in the paint bar to load that color onto a brush. (**NOTE: colors on the paint bar can be overridden**)
2. Click on the canvas to change the background color.



Feel free to use this project for messing around with Visual Basic. It includes FileIO, DialogBoxes, .NET, etc.
